# CTF - My collection of CTF writeups.

<h1>What is a CTF?</h1>
Capture the Flag (CTF) in computer security is an exercise in which "flags" are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites. 
Competitors steal flags either from other competitors (attack/defense-style CTFs) or from the organizers (jeopardy-style challenges).
Several variations exist, including hiding flags in hardware devices. 
Competitions exist both online and in-person, and can be advanced or entry-level. 
The game is based on the traditional outdoor sport of the same name.
Security CTFs are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world (i.e., bug bounty programs in professional settings).
